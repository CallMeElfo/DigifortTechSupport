# Digifort Registry Support

This small tool was developed with the aim of helping Digifort's Tech Support staff on daily issues and automating some of the check-ups that are done on a regular calls, such as deactivating/activating all cameras, checking machine code history, creating backups, stop/starting services, etc.
