# Digifort Cloud Check

This is a quick program designed to do routine checks for remote servers compliance with bitrate limitations.

The user can set any number of servers which will be added to the 'settings.ini' file either via adding through the user interface or manually editing the file.

On the lower left side the user can set the threshold for the tests (FPS and/or Bitrate) as well as the time (the longer the script runs, the more accurate it will be).
Once that is set the user can select the servers from the list and click on "Run!" to test the servers.

The system will then output the results of the test on the right side panel, letting the user know which customers need to be contacted to adjust their settings accordingly.
